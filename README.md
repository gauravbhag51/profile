### Description:
- A semi-formal website that introduces the reader to my interests and skills.
- Showcases some of the practice projects and my achivements till now.
- Many animations added with the help of CSS and JavaScript, which are mentioned above.
- Contains Link to my Social Media accounts, as well as GitHub account.
- Smooth transitions from one section to another with the help of JavaScript.
### Unique:
- As I mentioned earlier, my website is a semi-formal website, which not only showcases my academic interests but also my favourite recreational activities.
- The Famous Dialouges for each show provide the website a beautiful and intriguing effect. Gaining the attention of the reader.
- The disappearing and appearing sections as one scrolls the page gives the website a smooth effect and pleases the viewer.
### Problems Faced:
- The main problem faced by me was the transition effects and animations provided using JavaScript.
- The Sound effect should stop if the pic goes outside the viewport, adding this functionality took some time.
- The reappearing of the sections once disappeared and vice-versa gave many issues, but were solved at the end.
- The Preloader effect was a rwal challenge, took me a lot effort to get that right.
### Scope Of Improvement:
- As I am just a beginner, there remain many improvements that were possible but were out of my scope of knowledge.
- Adding some new animations and more projects to the portfolio will always be a dream.
- Making the website load faster will be something I will be looking forward to learn.
### Skills Learned:
- This project taught me tons of things.
- I did not JavaScript at all before this project, which I am proud to say, I have used very well in this page.
- I only had a little idea about CSS, but after this project I am more confident towards using it.
